🎮 Tetris in Python (Pygame-CE)

A fully functional recreation of the classic game Tetris, built in Python using the PyGame library.
This project features complete gameplay, scoring, graphics, sound effects, and background music.

🚀 Features

Classic Tetris gameplay (piece movement, rotation, line clearing, scoring).

Object-Oriented Design with modular classes for pieces, grid, and game logic.

Real-time graphics rendering using the Pygame library.

Integrated sound effects and background music.

Packaged as a standalone Windows installer for easy play.

Clean, well-documented code suitable for learning and teaching.

📚 Teaching Applications

This project is designed not just as a game, but as a teaching tool for computer science students.
It demonstrates:

Control structures (loops, conditionals).

Functions and modular programming.

Object-Oriented Programming (classes, methods, encapsulation).

Event handling and user input.

Graphics rendering and collision detection.

Packaging and deployment of Python applications.
